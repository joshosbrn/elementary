Hello UrbanStems,

From the looks of it, you received my email with interest in your product design position.

Just to reiterate what was in the body of that email; My name is Joe Letchford and I’m interested in talking about your open Product Design position. I recently moved to DC after the completion of my MFA in graphic design at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. My goal as a designer is to bridge my love for creating conceptually thoughtful designs and my passion for connecting individuals through design and participation. In the ‘Before We Start’ section you explain your company’s desire to create a happy and productive team. I’ve found it difficult to find an employer willing to put that personal effort into their staff’s well-being. After spending some time working in agencies, where the main focus is billable hours, that section alone sold me on UrbanStems as a potential workplace. On top of a graduate degree in design, I have 5 years of experience focusing on both print and digital design. I spent the last two years working on a thesis body which explored digital technology and personal experiences outdoors. All boiling down to an exhibition experience and a physical catalog. More recently I have been interested in product design and its correlation to my personal methodologies on design processes. Systematic development and process driven creation have always been where design works best for me, whether it is developing a publication or building web experiences.

Many of the websites I have built, or am currently building, start with a rapid prototype to check functionality and usability. I find that having the ability to see something live and clickable, no matter how rough the draft is, is exponentially greater for the design process. Creating these prototypes and getting deeper into code based collaboration, is why I want to move more into a product design track. The process is similar to my publication design practice and requires that I am actively learning new skills and pushing how I think on a day-to-day basis. Education, collaboration, and a healthy process are what I believe make me the most excited to design.

Parallel to my design process, I am also an outdoor enthusiast. My main activities include cycling and rock climbing and I have ridden my bike across the US twice, and once across Virginia. The potential to work for a company that obviously appreciates their messenger staff is a big plus. I believe my experience both in design and in the saddle would benefit your team in crafting thoughtful user experiences for customers and your staff.

Thank you for making your way to this site.

Best,

Joe Letchford.
