![Disconnection: A Reality]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/thesis/home.jpg)

The main body of work created parallel with the written thesis publication. This web interaction is my illustration of the Atmospheric Disconnection. Within this interaction I am pushing to create a piece that implements both an appreciation and observance, as well as an active element of participation. The web is activated by one individual whose touch directly effects the film. These interactions are my insights into my interest in our technologies and how they have reached a presence best illustrated as the atmosphere and how we reach moments of un-knowing in such a ubiquitous digital existence.
