This past year, I had the opportunity to work on "Game of the Year" a new initiative for Google’s “Year in Search” video recap of the biggest search trends that happened over the previous year. Specifically, I developed the brand identity for the new game while working alongside a larger team of developers, designers, and writers to develop the game’s UI interactions and elements.
