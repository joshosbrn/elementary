Front end web design for Riggs Ward Design, a multi-disciplinary firm located in the capital city of Richmond, Virginia. Riggs Ward focuses primarily on  visitor engagement in museums and cultural centers through experiential exhibit design, interactive media, innovative graphic design, and strategic master plans.

My job with Riggs Ward was to come in and do a redesign of all their internal printed materials which ultimately led to my redesigning their web presence.
