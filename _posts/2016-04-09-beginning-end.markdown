Beginning & End started with the desire to explore form and how I could use it to my advantage. The written content was aimed at investigating my perception of the ordinary. I believe that the deepest norms are those that we do not think about – things so ordinary they become the standard — and it was exactly this that I wanted to explore.

I found this physical concept created with the environment that I was attempting to create — Manipulating my idea of normal was an interesting way to learn more about myself and in turn, allow for introspection. Working through the ideas of creating environmental work and keeping true to material and simplicity.

When I design, I am constantly exploring new ways of creating work that can speak to an ever-growing body of individuals, myself included. I do this by referencing work and systems that have already been successful while simultaneously implementing new forms. It is through this that I can begin to build a body of work that represents myself while simultaneously engaging those around me..
