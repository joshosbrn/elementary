Throughout my graduate process, I found myself using the same few photoshop files to edit assets for projects I was creating. One day all the layers turned on and the outcome wasn't dissimilar to these images. I have since continued to pursue these visual mashups and they have ultimately informed a good deal of my practice. They have become a defining aspect to my production and methodological process.

Digital, not yet physical.
