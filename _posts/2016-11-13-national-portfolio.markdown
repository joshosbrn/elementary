DesignWorks was asked by NPDA to create this years international National Portfolio Day poster. My concept revolved around the scanning bed and the gesture of casting your works in front of a potential institution for critique. I wanted to keep it fun and also give myself the change to run around and play with my typographic choices as well as my formal elements. It was an absolute blast to create this poster.
