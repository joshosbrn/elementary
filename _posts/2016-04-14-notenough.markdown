Not Enough is an exhibition which explores how our experience of natural landscapes has been permanently altered by an increasingly digital culture. Inspired by the work of George Shiras III, a forefather of nature photography, and the writings of John Berger, artist and author of Ways of Seeing, this installation is a foray into the Frankenstein landscapes created and subsequently sought by a public that has little experience with an unfiltered, unedited, unidealized natural world.


Not Enough was an installation at Gallery 148 in Minneapolis during my MFA candidacy at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.
