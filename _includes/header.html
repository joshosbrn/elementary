<div class="about">
    <div class="header-column">
      <h2> Currently </h2>
      <p> Joe Letchford is an American graphic designer pursuing his MFA from the <a href="http://www.mcad-mfa.com/">Minneapolis College of Art and Design.</a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header-column">
      <h2> Statement </h2>
      <p>His personal work currently focuses predominantly on exploring how our experience of natural landscapes have been permanently altered by an increasingly digital culture. These observations and experimentations are opportunities to explore his mental space, ways of thinking, creation processes—as well as on the results of these efforts.
      </p>
      <p>Joe’s work has and will always be in a state of flux, one that is constantly changing—maybe not drastically—but certainly always. Always growing from successful and unsuccessful ideas. Re-working the thoughts and sharpening the concepts, Joe is always chiseling out the framework of his methods of production and thought process.  He is constantly working.
